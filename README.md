# basic-tutorial-fastapi
A FastAPI project demonstrating how to set up separate test (staging) and production environments using GitHub branches and Render services. The repository shows a workflow where changes are deployed to a test environment first, verified, and then merged to production, enabling safe and structured deployment without using a local machine.
